# Simplified Version (3 Apps)

This version has been simplified to include only 3 core Frappe apps for better stability and faster deployment:

1. **Frappe HRMS** - HR and Payroll management
2. **Frappe CRM** - Sales and customer management
3. **Frappe LMS** - Learning and training management

## Why Simplified?

Building all 7 apps simultaneously requires significant resources (8GB+ RAM, powerful CPU) and can take 15-20 minutes. This simplified version:

- ✅ Builds faster (5-10 minutes)
- ✅ Uses less memory (4GB RAM sufficient)
- ✅ More stable on limited resources
- ✅ Easier to troubleshoot

## Full Version Available

The full version with all 7 apps (HRMS, CRM, LMS, Drive, Insights, Gameplan, Helpdesk) is available in:
- `docker-compose.full.yml`
- `apps.full.json`
- `Dockerfile.full`

To use the full version, you'll need a more powerful server (8GB+ RAM, 4+ CPU cores).
